# TimeTime
TimeTime is a multifunction alarm watch (e.g. Casio) created on Logisim, using digital systems such as logic gates. Then it can be uploaded on an FPGA board, we worked on the DE10-Lite.
It was my third project at EPFL, in Bachelor Microengineering.

## Launch the program
Open the file [TimeTime](TimeTime.circ) with Logisim-evolution v3.7.2. To upload it on an FPGA board, use the menu FPGA>"Synthesize & Download". Then you have to connect the different I/O of the board corresponding to the I/O of the circuit. (You can refer to the document [report](report.pdf).)

## How it works ?

## Logisim
This project uses the software Logisim-evolution v3.7.2. You may encounter some issues if you try to open it with an earlier version.
